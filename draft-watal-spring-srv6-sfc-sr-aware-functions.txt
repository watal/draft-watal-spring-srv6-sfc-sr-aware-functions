1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) [RFC8986] enables packet steering
   through a set of instructions called a segment list.  Each SR segment
   endpoint node provides SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors, including Prefix/
   Adjacency Segments, VPNs, and Binding Segments.

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665] can be used in various
   scenarios (e.g.  FW, IPS, IDS, NAT, and DPI).  SFC based on Segment
   Routing (SR) is defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-spring-sr-service-programming], which describes some
   SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors, such as End.AS/AD/AM, are necessary for
   using SR-unaware functions.

   This document describes an architecture for SRv6 SFC with SR-aware
   functions, which provides comprehensive management of SRv6 network
   resources and services.

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Design Objectives and Assumptions

   ## Goals/Objectives SRv6 SFC Architecture is designed with two main
   objectives:

   *  Comprehensive Management: a centralized controller for SFC,
      handling SR Policy, link-state, and network metrics.  When
      providing SRv6 services, meeting SLAs for each customer is
      required.  These SLAs consist of one or more SLOs such as
      availability, latency, and bandwidth.  In an SRv6 SFC network,
      service segment provisioning, link-state collection, and SR Policy
      calculation are required to meet SLOs, respectively.

      [RFC8402] outlines a hybrid control plane that merges a
      distributed control plane and a centralized control plane.  In
      this hybrid control plane, forwarding information like Node/
      Adjacency SIDs are advertised mutually by distributed SR nodes via
      IGPs such as ISIS and OSPF, while other information like SR
      Policies and service segments are provided by a centralized
      controller.

      Software-Defined Networking (SDN) [RFC7426] provides centralized
      management of a network by a controller and a manager.
      Centralized management reduces operational costs through
      abstraction and automation.  The SDN framework allows users to
      manage an SR domain without considering the details of a
      forwarding plane like a topology and node state.  Operators can
      use an SRv6 controller to build SR Policies for SFC and QoS,
      manage the state of network functions, issue service segments
      automatically, and specify disaster recovery with protection.

   *  Simplicity: no SFC proxies, so that reduces nodes and address
      resource consumption.  Network complexity increases operating
      costs.  Generally, using a variety of protocols in a network
      raises operational costs, including designing, building,
      monitoring, and troubleshooting.

      Using an SFC proxy may increase forwarding overhead due to
      additional header manipulations.

3.1.  Assumptions

   To achieve these objectives, this architecture is based on two main
   assumptions:

   *  Straightforward extension of the SRv6 network programming model

      The protocol used in this architecture is compatible with SRv6.
      This streamlines the operation of services like traffic steering,
      including SFC, redundancy, and local protection.  Standardized
      protocols such as BGP, PCEP, IS-IS, OSPF, TI-LFA, and Anycast SID
      are used in this architecture.

      This architecture is SRv6 compliant, enabling support for SR-
      unaware functions, although SR-aware functions are expected to
      meet the objective.

   *  SDN framework compliance and comprehensive management of SRv6 SFC
      by controllers

      A controller is used to provide comprehensive management.  To
      simplify building and operating, the controller uses standardized
      protocols and abstracted service interfaces.  This also provides
      programmability by controlling policies that meet a user's intent
      including SFC and quality of service (QoS).

    Figure 1: Overview of SRv6 SFC Architecture with SR-aware Functions

   This architecture is based on SDN [RFC7426] separating the forwarding
   plane (FP), control plane (CP), management plane (MP), and
   application plane (AP).  Each plane has the following roles:

   *  Forwarding Plane: classifies packets and encapsulates SRH,
      forwards them, and applies SRv6 Endpoint Behavior.

      -  Provides SR-aware function using End.AN.

      -  Classify flow and apply them to TE application with PBR.

      -  Ensures redundancy with anycast.

      -  Ensure local protection with Fast Reroute (FRR).

   *  Control Plane: makes decisions about packet forwarding and
      provides rules for a forwarding plane.

      -  Collects link-state including SRv6 locator, prefix, behavior,
         and delay.

      -  Calculates and provisioning SR Policies.

      -  Applies SR Policies to each flow by provisioning flow
         classification rules.

      -  Manages the provisioning of service segments to SR-aware
         functions.

   *  Management Plane: monitors and maintenances of SRv6 devices and
      services

      -  Monitors and deploys network functions.

      -  Manages hypervisor resources.

      -  Collects metrics of devices, network functions, and SFC
         services.

   *  Application Plane: provides APIs for users to use a control and
      management plane.

      -  Provide an interface to operators or customers.

      -  Applying intents defined in [RFC9315], including Operational,
         Rule, Service, and Flow intents.

   Each component communicates using standardized protocols.  These are
   designed to be loosely coupled and cooperate by using an abstraction
   layer.

   This document suggests handling a control plane by application plane,
   but a detailed design of an application plane is out of the scope of
   this document.  This is because application plane components and
   abstraction layers should be designed based on individual network
   utilization and operator intent.  In the following sections, details
   of a forwarding plane, control plane, and management plane are
   explained.

5.  Forwarding Plane

   A forwarding plane is responsible for providing SFC through packet
   classification, SRv6 encapsulation, and forwarding.  In this
   architecture, all forwarding plane components are located within the
   SR domain.

    +----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | +--------------+             +--------+             +--------+ |
    | |  SR Source   | SRv6 Packet |  SRv6  | SRv6 Packet |  SRv6  | |
    | |     Node     |(S2,S1; SL:1)|Service |(S2,S1; SL:1)|Service | |
   -->|  / Service   |------------>|Function|------------>|Function|-->
    | |Classification|             |  Node  |             |  Node  | |
    | |   Function   |             |  (S1)  |             |  (S2)  | |
    | +--------------+             +--------+             +--------+ |
    +-------------------------- SR domain ---------------------------+

                         Figure 2: Forwarding Plane

   Figure 2 shows an example of SFC with two network functions.
   Firstly, the SR source node classifies the flow and encapsulates it
   with an SRH containing the segment list <S1, S2>.  Next, the SRv6
   service function node (S1) receives the packet and applies a network
   function associated with an End.AN S1.  Finally, the SRv6 service
   function node (S2) receives the packet and also applies a network
   function associated End.AN S2, thus achieving SFC.

5.1.  End.AN-based Service Segment Provisioning

   End.AN provides an SR-aware function.

   Functions with the same role MAY be assigned as the same service
   segment within the SR domain.  By using Anycast SIDs, multiple nodes
   can be grouped as part of the same service segment.

   End.AN MAY have optional arguments.  This can provide additional
   programmability by embedding network function instructions in the
   segment list.

   By using virtualized spaces within routers or on generic servers,
   network functions can be provided at any node in an SR domain.  This
   allows for scaling and flexible redundancy of network functions.

5.1.1.  When a Network Function Goes Down

   If a network function experiences a failure, the associated route
   MUST be promptly removed.  In the case of anycast configuration, it
   MUST be gracefully rerouted to other nodes.  Additionally, if no
   alternative nodes are available, consider either dropping the packet
   and sending an ICMP Destination Unreachable message or forwarding it
   as a pass-through.

5.1.2.  Anycast Segment

   The concept of the Anycast Segment is introduced in [RFC8402].  In
   the SRv6 SFC, it realizes to provide the same network function
   segment as the same Anycast Segment.  In such cases, the state
   between network functions MUST be shared mutually.

5.1.3.  Fast Reroute

   The ordering of network functions in an SRv6 SFC is guaranteed by the
   segment list, even if an FRR occurs, When an FRR occurs, if the
   Active segment is an Anycast SID, it MAY be forwarded to another SRv6
   service function node.  In such a case, since state synchronization
   may not have been completed, the network function MUST have a
   mechanism to handle rerouted packets, such as buffering to wait for
   synchronization.

5.2.  Service Function Chains

   In this architecture, each SFC is represented as an SR Policy.  The
   purpose or intent of each SR Policy can be identified using
   attributes such as color or name.

   In general, SFC is achieved by using loose source routing.  If both
   SFC and QoS are desired, they can be achieved by using strict source
   routing or loose source routing with Flex-Algo SIDs.

5.3.  Per-Flow Encapsulation

   In an SR source node, which serves as the Service Classification
   Function, packets are classified on a per-flow basis using PBR and
   encapsulated with SR Policy.  Therefore, the SR source node MUST be
   capable of identifying packets using at least a 5-tuple or even more
   detailed information.

   In this architecture, aiming for comprehensive management, the
   Service Classification Function has an API to communicate with the
   controller.

6.  Control Plane

   A control plane is responsible for enabling comprehensive management
   of SRv6 SFC.  It enables SR-aware functions as service segments and
   specifies SR Policies including SFC for each flow.  A control plane
   has a Northbound API to receive user requests and a Southbound API to
   manipulate a forwarding plane.

    | |           Function           | |           Node            | |
    | +------------------------------+ +---------------------------+ |
    +--------------------------- SR domain --------------------------+

                          Figure 3: Control Plane

   The SRv6 Controller consists of the following three components:

   *  Service Function Controller: provides an SID for a network service
      and manages this state.

   *  PCE: provides SR Policies that fulfill SFC/QoS requirements from
      the headend to the tailend and sends them to the SR source node.

   *  Classification Rule Controller: provides an Encapsulation Policy
      that corresponds to a specific flow and SR Policy, and sends them
      to the SR source node.

6.1.  Service Function Controller

   Service Function Controller is responsible for enabling and disabling
   service segments of SRv6 service function nodes.  To manage service
   segments, it utilizes the extensions provided in a BGP-LS service
   segment, as outlined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sr-service-segments] and TODO: draft-
   watal-idr-bgp-ls-sr-service-segments-enabler, and defines the
   following parameters:

   *  Behavior: End.AN

   *  SID: the SID of End.AN (in IPv6 Address format).  Service segments
      that support slicing are specified here as Flex-Algo SIDs.

   *  Function Name: type of network function

   *  Action: enable

   *  TLV:

      -  Specification of the Anycast Group: when deploying multiple
         Network Functions within the same context, it MUST use the
         Anycast Group TLV to specify the same anycast group SID.

      -  Allows for the specification of unique parameters and context
         associated with a particular network function.

6.2.  Path Computation Element (PCE)

   PCE is a controller that provides SR Policy.  As an Active Stateful
   PCE, it establishes sessions with all PEs in an SR domain and manages
   SFCs.  SR Policies MUST support both explicit and dynamic paths.  For
   dynamic path, Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) considers not
   only SFC but also QoS.

   It acquires the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) of the SR domain
   using BGP-LS and deploys SR Policies via PCEP [RFC5440] or BGP SR
   Policy [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].  The BGP-LS
   service segment is required to calculate dynamic paths based on the
   state of service segments and network functions.

6.3.  Classification Rule Controller

   A Classification Rule Controller determines flows to apply specific
   SFC.

   The classification results are advertised to each SR source node as a
   set of flow, endpoints, and color with an extended protocol based on
   BGP Flowspec defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-ts-flowspec-srv6-policy].

7.  Management Plane

   A management plane is responsible for configuring network function
   instances, monitoring resources, and collecting network metrics.  The
   details of each manager are outside the scope of this document, as
   the southbound interface of the management plane may be different for
   each service and hardware architecture.

    | +---------------------------------------------+ |
    +------------------- SR domain -------------------+

                         Figure 4: Management Plane

   Figure 4 shows examples of managers that MAY be added to a management
   plane:

   *  VNF Manager: handles deployment and scaling of network functions.

      -  VNF Manager keeps links redundant and optimize link
         utilization.

   *  VIM: monitors hypervisor resources on SRv6 service function nodes.

      -  In SRv6 SFC, a hypervisor managed by a VIM MAY be located in
         virtualized spaces within routers or on generic servers.

   *  Network Metrics Manager: collects metrics for SR Policy
      calculation and evaluation.

      -  Metrics are collected from multiple data sources, including
         IPFIX, TCP statistics, and SRv6 path tracing
         [I-D.draft-filsfils-spring-path-tracing].

      -  Metrics can be used for PCE calculation parameters.
